<p><a href="http://cmstatistics.org/EcoSta2019/">The 3rd International Conference on Econometrics and Statistics (EcoSta 2019)</a> took place at the National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), Taichung, Taiwan 25-27 June 2019. The conference consisted of 10 parallel sessions, each having 14-17 sessions with 3-5 speakers occurring at the same time. The full programme is available <a href="http://cmstatistics.org/EcoSta2019/fullprogramme.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was quite the optimization problem to pick which sessions to attend. For parallel sessions where multiple sessions appeared interesting and relevant for my research, my final choice became rather arbitrary.</p>
<p>After the conference, I decided to put my newly acquired web scraping skills to good use. After collecting the names of the 593 presenting authors at the conference (and the co-authors of their presented papers) from the conference web site, I scraped the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> profile of each author, to obtain a citation count for each of the 150 sessions.</p>
<div id="the-code" class="section level2">
<h2>The code</h2>
<p>I started by scraping sessions, authors and titles using the methods from my <a href="https://www.kjartako.no/post/hockey-web-scraping-data-aggregation/">previous post</a>. Then I wrote a function which calculates the total citation count for a session (consisting of 3-5 presentations). Calling the function for each session, and calculating the column sum of the returned citation matrix, gives the desired results.</p>
<p><details> <summary>Citation count function</summary></p>
<pre class="r"><code># The input is a vector of URLs (each talk has an info web page)
# Returns a Nx2 matrix:
# First column: Presenting authors citation sum 
# Second column: Total citation sum
scoreFunc=function(talklist)
{
  N = length(talklist)
  score=matrix(0,nrow=N,ncol=2)
  ScholarURL=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=&quot;

  for(u in 1:N)
  {
    talk_html = read_html(talklist[u],encoding =&quot;UTF-8&quot;)
    talk=talk_html%&gt;%html_node(&quot;.newline+ span&quot;)%&gt;%html_text()

    authors=strsplit(talk, split=&quot;\\)&quot;)[[1]]
    authors=gsub(&quot;\\[presenting]&quot;,&quot;&quot;,authors)
    for(i in 1:length(authors))
    {
      authors[i]=gsub(&quot; &quot;,&quot;+&quot;,strsplit(authors[i], split=&quot;\\(&quot;)[[1]][1])
      if(nchar(authors[i])&gt;3)
      {
        author_html = read_html(paste(ScholarURL,authors[i],sep=&quot;&quot;))
        tmp=strsplit(toString(author_html%&gt;%html_node(&quot;body&quot;)%&gt;%html_text()), split=&quot;Cited by &quot;)[[1]]
        if(grepl(&quot;Verified email&quot;, tmp[1], fixed=TRUE))
        {
          tmpscore=as.numeric(gsub(&quot;([0-9]+).*$&quot;, &quot;\\1&quot;, tmp[2]))
          if(i==1){score[u,1]=tmpscore}
          score[u,2]=score[u,2]+tmpscore
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return(score)
}</code></pre>
